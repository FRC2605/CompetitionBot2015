FRC Team 2605's competition code for 2015
=========================================

This repository contains all the source code for FRC Team 2605's Recycle Rush robot. It relies heavily on a library called [LARUL](https://github.com/FRC2605/CodeDevelopment/tree/master/LARUL), which can be viewed in our [CodeDevelopment repository](https://github.com/FRC2605/CodeDevelopment/tree/master). 

The goal of this repository is to be 1-to-1 with the source directory of the operating code on our robot, and as such, undergoes frequent changes, as does [CodeDevelopment/LARUL](https://github.com/FRC2605/CodeDevelopment/tree/master/LARUL).
